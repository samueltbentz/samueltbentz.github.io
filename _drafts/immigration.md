"A government's job is to secure the good of its citizens/subjects. Its job is not to secure the good of all the other countries of the world or of their people."
Rick Davis

Weird has become the Democrat approved label for Republican V.P. candidate, J.D. Vance. In his first rally as the Democrat V.P. candidate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota said this referring to Trump & Vance, "You know it, you feel it. These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell." There really is not a better description of the battle in America today than the battle over what is normal and what is weird. Vance, a Marine veteran, successful businessman, author, and a married, father of 3 is deemed weird by the left. For radical candidates like Harris & Walz to be at the top of the ticket for the left means they are trying to legitimize their positions or in other words, they are trying to normalize their strangeness. The society they envision is built around catering to the exceptions rather than to the norms of life. In his book "No Place for Truth", David Wells helpfully explained this dilemma, "Worldliness is that set of practices in a society, its values and ways of looking at life, that make sin look normal and righteousness look strange. It thus gives great plausibility to what is morally wrong and, for that reason, makes what is wrong seem normal."
