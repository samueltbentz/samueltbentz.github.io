*Below is my submitted written testimony against [HB25-1312: concerning legal protections for transgender individuals](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1312).*

I strongly urge the State Senators of Colorado to oppose HB25-1312. The reasons are as follows:

1. The extremely broad definition of coercive control includes a parent “regulating the individual’s everyday behavior.” Any reasonable parent regulates their child’s behavior every single day by handing them a coat as they walk outside on a cold day or limiting their screen time. Such a wide definition opens every sensible parent to lose custody of their children for performing basic parental responsibilities.

2. The bill includes “misgendering” and “deadnaming” as forms of coercive control which compels speech and demands businesses, schools and parents to lie to children about their gender & sex. Colorado must not live by lies.

3. Lastly, and more fundamentally, this bill aims to desecrate and destroy any basic understanding of reality in our state. By declaring that boys can be girls and girls can be boys, this bill will work to destroy all order in Colorado. Any objectivity to the world is tarnished if something so simple cannot be distinguished. It doesn’t matter how many laws are passed, you cannot alter nature and reality. God has created this world and made His truth plain and clear for all to see. If Colorado legislators continue to reject Christ and His ways, our state will further its decline and decay into chaos and disorder.

Instead, honor God, serve the citizens of Colorado and protect the children of this state by opposing HB25-1312.

Thank you.
