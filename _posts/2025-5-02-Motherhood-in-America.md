In a recent talk at the  Natal Conference, Jonathan Keeperman (otherwise known as Lomez) wisely warned of the danger of politicizing having children. While courageously calling for the disbanding of the conference at which he spoke, Keeperman explained that the act of having children and starting a family is natural and pre-political. "The miracle of having kids belongs to God, not to Caesar." The Natal Conference has a particular eye towards the falling fertility rate in America and around the world. Keeperman acknowledges the danger of the demographic future of humanity but believes an effective response "requires stepping back from anxiety-driven politics and embracing a healthier, more natural relationship with parenthood itself." For Keeperman, the aim of having children is not to win a political contest by outbreeding the Left but rather embracing parenthood as an end unto itself.

Keeperman's exhortations are appropriate and necessary given the over-politicization of all aspects of life, including children. He is also correct in identifying the folly of heavy-handed, coercive pressure to increase the number of children born each year. Children are not political trophies to be displayed and his proposals are a breath of fresh air. However, such an approach falls short when it fails to acknowledge the real civic effects of parenthood. His speech, perhaps ironically given to an overwhelmingly male audience, was not directed towards women but the reality in America today is that women are increasingly trending Leftward. Being on the Left today politically means affirmation of abortion, LGBTQ+, illegal immigration and soft on crime policies. But it also means a rejection of the natural family and a rejection of parenthood. Women rejecting motherhood seems to be a new phenomonemon and to use Keeperman's language, certainly anti-nature. Not having a child for a woman requires active participation and real cost, physically and financially, to prevent what ought to be natural. The question reamins, how can the Right effectively convince women to embrace motherhood amidst a culture so vehemently opposed to what is natural?

On the other hand, the harvest seems to be white for young men in America and many are refocusing their efforts to reach men who rightly hold a distaste for modern life. This political gap between the sexes is particularly strong in the younger generations and we are beginning to see the negative consequences when the divide gives way to resentment and competition.  While the developments amongst young men are encouraging and hopefully continue, women cannot be ignored. Reaching women today will certainly be a more difficult task for the Right given the widespread adoption of feminism, which is a bipartisan pillar in America. Even Megyn Kelly, a major voice on the Right, recently spoke to young women on her podcast telling them to never settle. A contrasting dose of reality from the Right will likely fall on deaf ears when the prevailing message to women is "you can have it all."

In this moment, Christians are uniquely equipped for the task of offering a compelling and positive vision for women to seek motherhood. Motherhood is a good unto itself, like Keeperman observed, but there also is a correlation between the quality of motherhood and American national prosperity. A nation ought to have a real interest in the health of families and children, which in most cases relies heavily on the success of mothers. Charlotte Mason even begins her series for women on Home Education with the statement, "Children are a Public Trust." America has a history of honoring the role of motherhood in society. When Alexander de Tocqueville visited early America, he famously observed that the women of the young nation were largely unseen and yet essential to its success. "If anyone asks me what I think the chief cause of the extraordinary prosperity and growing power of this nation, I should answer that it is due to the superiority of their women." Founding Princeton Seminary professor, Archibald Alexander, wrote a letter of counsel to Christian mothers in 1844 in which he aimed "to arouse them to the consideration of the importance of the station which they occupy, and to persuade them to exert that influence which they possess." Alexander acknowledged the concern of insignificance many women had, even in the mid-nineteenth century, that their impact in society was minimal due to their station. Alexander called such a notion a "flagrant miscalculation" and explained that their influence is real and effective. He went on to observe, "It may, in an important sense, be said that the Commonwealth has been preserved from utter destruction by the prudence, purity and piety of Virginian mothers. They have been the salt which has arrested the progress of moral corruption in the mass of society." Alexander understood that mothers and the home were essential for any hope of reformation or renewal of all social institutions, civil and religious. As President in 1905, Theodore Roosevelt compared wilful childlessness to a soldier who runs away in battle. Roosevelt didn't diminish the work of the mother in the home but instead ennobled the duties by connecting the dots between what they do at home and the greatness of America. He concluded his remarks by saying, "The woman's task is not easy--no task worth doing is easy--but in doing it, and when she has done it, there shall come to her the highest and holiest joy known to mankind; and having done it, she shall have the reward prophesied in Scripture; for her husband and her children, yes, and all people who realize that her work lies at the foundation of all national happiness and greatness, shall rise up and call her blessed."

Keeperman is correct, women should not be told to have children simply for the sake of revitalizing America or winning a political contest. It is truthful, however, and right to acknowledge the necessity of women embracing motherhood as a natural vocation as an actual good for our nation. Children are not a burden or obstacle for women as they aim to make an impact on society and nor are children a means for a political end. Being a mother is a significant role, not only in the life of her children, but also in the life of a community. The responsibilities of motherhood rightly understood must be honored, celebrated and recognized, especially when such a decision for a woman requires going against significant cultural headwinds. Like de Tocqueville observed, a healthy America has women at home and out of the public sphere. And yet, it is in the home where women leave an indelible mark, not only on their families, but on the future of America.

"No piled-up wealth, no splendor of material growth, no brilliance of artistic development, will permanently avail any people unless its home life is healthy, unless the average man possesses honesty, courage, common sense, and decency, unless he works hard and is willing at need to fight hard; and unless the average woman is a good wife, a good mother, able and willing to perform the first and greatest duty of womanhood, able and willing to bear, and to bring up as they should be brought up, healthy children, sound in body, mind, and character, and numerous enough so that the race shall increase and not decrease."
